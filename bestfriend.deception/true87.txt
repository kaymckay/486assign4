"I've been friends with Jason since 10th grade.  When we first met it was for a game of ""War Games"", where we would go into the woods and throw eggs, firecrackers, and bags of floor at each other.  Our group of friends has gone camping several times since then, sometimes for a week straight.  Jason and I share alot of interests and have found our views on life are very much in common."
