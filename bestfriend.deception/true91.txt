Stacy and I have been friends since high school. She is an extremely compassionate and ethical person and a defender of anyone weaker or less fortunate. She is generous with her family and friends as well as with strangers. She has an infectious laugh and a winning personality that everyone responds positively to. Children and dogs both love her, which is, in my opinion, one of the best signs of a truly kind person.
