"Well i never really liked a classmate of mine. We used to have this atmosphere of tension between us and everyone knew about that. My motto is "" Be nice to people who are good with you and never bother about the rest who talk bad behind your back"" I can never stand someone spreading rumours about me or the other person. If u have any grudges against a person just let them know what harm did they ever do to you and just move on.Life is too short for all this. Better live it to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it"
