My best friend is Craig.  We have been friends since we were born, basically, since our parents new each other.  We are such good friends because we have so much shared life experience.  We went to summer camp together and went to the same church.  We have a lot of common opinions, but we also disagree about things.  What keeps us together is mutual respect for each other even if we disagree.
