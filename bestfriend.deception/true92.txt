I love my best friend! He is also my husband. He is very supportive, funny, and sincere. He is always telling me that I'm a great wife and mother, and our personality's just work really well together. He's a lot like me in some ways, for instance he's very easy going, and likes to have fun. He's also me opposite in other ways like his spending habits. He's a spender, while I'm a saver. He's very detailed which makes him slow at getting things done, while I'm very fast and not as detailed. Together we make the perfect team.
