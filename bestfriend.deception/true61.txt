My best friend knows me better than I know myself. Wshen we argue it never lasts more than a day and he is always there to listen. He will make me happy when I'm down and laugh when I want to cry. He will take the kids out for a few hours when I feel as i I was going to explode, and bring them back just as I start to miss them.
