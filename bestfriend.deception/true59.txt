We have been best friends for about 15 years. My biggest issue with him is his lack of commitment to relationships and completing college (at night). I find that he is dedicated to work not too much, but more than the other things in his life. I think he would make a great father if he would put an effort into his relationships. He could also do much better in his carreer if he would complete college, but one or two classes a year will not get it done.
