My best friend has earned her title, I can literally tell her anything in confidence and know that I can trust her enough not to tell a single soul.  We grew up together, been best friends now for about 12 years.  She always knows exactly how I feel, even if I don't tell her.  She makes me laugh more than any other person I know, and some of my most precious childhood memories I share with her.  She has never been afraid to tell me exactly what she thinks about my life, never afraid to tell me where I went wrong.  She has proven herself day in and day out to be loyal, trustworthy, consistent, fun, caring, I could go on and on all day about her.  Our personalities are entirely different, but so much alike at the same time, we do butt heads at times because of this, but it's so hard to stay mad at her.
