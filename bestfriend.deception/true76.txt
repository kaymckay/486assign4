I've known my best friend for 38 years. We grew up together as neighbors. From the age of nine, we played together and hung out constantly. Now that we're older, there have been long periods of time when we haven't seen each other. It doesn't matter: She's just as sweet and loyal as ever. We'll always be best friends.
