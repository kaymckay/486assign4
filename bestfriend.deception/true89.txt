I have known my best friend my entire life.  We are actually cousins.  She and I started and finished school together.  My friend is kind, fun, loving and a good person.  We do not see each other as much as we would like because of distance, but when we do it is like we were never apart.  I trust her completly.  She is hard working and honest.  I respect her very much.
