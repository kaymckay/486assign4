My best friend is a woman that I became friends with when we were both college students. We have maintained our friendship despite the fact that we have not lived in the same state for more than twenty years. We both have the same type of sarcastic humor and still crack each other up. I trust that she would never betray a confidence and she always gives me a straight answer, even when it is difficult to do so. We keep in touch by phone and e-mail, as well as several visits during the year. I value her friendship and love tremendously.
