I am a guy and I have a girl as my best friend. We both share a very healthy relationship. She is my best friend because she just understands me better than anyone else I have ever met. She can tell herself without my need to say that what I want to say. Time seems running to me in her company. I can chat with her whole day and she also does this for me. She never hides anything from me. She always does those things which please me and even if I get upset with her she tries her level best so that our friendship continues as such. She really is best person for me in my life.
