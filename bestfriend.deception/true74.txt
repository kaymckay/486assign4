My best friend and I have similar opinions on a lot of important topics (religion/politics etc) and even if we don't agree on something we respect each other enough to be able to have a mature interesting discussion about our beliefs. We also make each other laugh all the time, we love watching movies together and cracking jokes about them, I feel that this ability is what bonds us. We are comfortable telling each other anything and always want the others honest opinion concerning any problems we are having in our lives. We know the other person cares so we can be brutally honest with each other and this also leads to our forming a stronger bond. I know my best friend would do anything for me and I would do anything for her.
