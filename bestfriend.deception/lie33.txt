"Marie has always been a challenging person for some people, but she has always been an easy person to talk to.  In the ""old days"" we spent most of our time hanging out at bowling alleys, drinking coffee with tons of cream and sugar, pretending to be ""with it"" among all the other people there.  Our birthdays are only thirteen months apart, so she was always like the little-bit-older sister I never had.  We could always find something to do, whether before or after school; or during the week or on the weekend.  We always had fun.  "
