I've known my best friend for almost 4 years. She gives great advice, and is constantly helping me work through problems that I'd go crazy trying to deal with on my own. She's always there, even when I text her in the middle of the night because I can't sleep. She has a great laugh, too, and tells the most awesome stories - ones that leave us both gasping for air and holding our aching sides, unable to stop laughing.
