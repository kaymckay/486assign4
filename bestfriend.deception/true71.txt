I have known my best friend since 3rd grade. We have been apart for lengthy times and once we lived near each other again, we picked up where we left off. I feel as if I know her and she knows me. I trust her and I ask for her advice. We respect each other's lives, like each others husband and children and don't get offended if the other is too busy for the other.  She is sincere and doesn't ever make me feel bad.  I could call her in the middle of the night and she would be there. My family loves her and knows her. We can giggle like school girls and cry like the grown women we are together.  We listen to one another.
