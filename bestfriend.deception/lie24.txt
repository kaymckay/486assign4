She has to be sarcastic all the time.  Whenever she praises, it appears as if that is the only redeeming aspect of my personality, otherwise I would be a total flop.  She compliments me on the days I know I have not dressed well.  She smiles with assurance when I declare my failings.  She happily forgets my birthdays and apologizes with impunity on the next day.  Isn't she my best friend?.  I daresay she is.
