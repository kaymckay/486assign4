My best friend is someone I met over 8 years ago. Despite our petty arguments, we always realize that we need each other more than it is worth it to hold grudges. We have so much in common that it's impossible for us to stay mad at one another. We share a similar sense of humor, similar taste in such things as movies, books, and music, and we both like to relax at home as much as we like to get dressed up and go out dancing. Having been through so much in the past 8 years-graduating from high school, going to college, moving away from home, rushing a sorority, graduating from college, applying to law school, student teaching, etc-there are few people who have been there for all of it, but my best friend has.
