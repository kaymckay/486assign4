My best friend is my boyfriend. He became my best friend after my last best friend left me for alcohol and drugs, and while I was hurting, he picked up the pieces and helped me to move past the fact that my past friend didn't want me around anymore. He listened to my cry, and held me when I needed comfort. He shopped with me for clothes and took me to get my hair done. We ate chocolate cake and stayed in bed watching movies. I never knew that romance could be mixed with friendship, but he taught me that the most important part of being inlove was also being best friends too. I appreciate how devoted he was to proving me that he wouldn't leave me like she did.
