Jay is my best friend and has been for almost 10 years.  We of course fight on ocassion, we are like the odd couple.  We are always pondering how we ended up such good friends as we are so completely different.  He likes sports and technology and I love music and literature.  I would go to an art museum in a heart beat while he wouldn't be dragged there by his hair.  He much prefers golfing and I think it has to be the most boring sport in the world.  He hasn't read a book since highschool and I read one a week.  He is all about the action movies with blood, gore, and blowing things up.  I love comedies with Jim Carey.  The funny part is, no matter what we are doing, we always have fun together.  Even if he is watching wrestling and I am reading, we just click for some reason.  I think our saving grace is our sense of humor and the fact that we are both so open minded.
