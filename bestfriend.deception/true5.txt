A and I have been friends for 5 years. He is always there for me when I am having a meltdown about something. We can get into a big fight and still continue being friends. One time he told me he hated me and never wanted to talk to me again. Yet, the very next day we were airtight again. This is why we are such good friends. Our ability to not carry a grudge and love one another no matter what helps us to stay close.
