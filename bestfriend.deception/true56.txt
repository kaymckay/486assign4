There is one friend of mine who is very dear to me. The best thing about him is listens to my talk very carefully and respond too in a very intelligent way. In others words he is a very good listener. He never wants me to go wrong in any case. He used to tell me that always take care of your parents . They are like GOD to us. He is the one who always comes on my birthday first!He really cares for me and my family.
