If ever I have had a better friend who loves me and accepts the person I am despite the vast differences in culture, I sure can't think of one better than Jeanne.  Right from the beggining, she has shown nothing but love and understanding.  She never says I am wrong, only offers different ways of seeing any situation.  She is the most talented, non-judgemental person I have ever met.
