He was my best friend in high school. I was the introvert type while he is the opposite. He was always cheerful every time I met him. He will often invite me to some of his friends birthday parties. He never made me feel like I was all alone. But then, we both had to go to separate classes. Things began to change when each time I saw him with his new classmate. He started to ignore me and I no longer was invited to any parties. One day, he even intentionally dropped a cup of hot water on me just to spite me. I knew then I could no longer trust his loyalty to me.
