What I like about this person is his clear and concise image of himself.  He knows who he is and what he wants and will not be waylaid in his pursuit of his dream.  He is honest and forthright and does not pretend to like things that he really does not like.  His views and codes of honor are not always mainstream but he adheres to them nonetheless.  If something is on his mind and bothering him, he will tell you so so it can be fixed and life can go back to normal.  He is always neat and well groomed.
