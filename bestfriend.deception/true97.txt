Kristy is the kind of friend everyone needs in their life.  Her heart is pure gold and her compassion is second to none.  The security of knowing if I ever needed her, no matter the time, place, or situation, she would be there without hesitation is something that is a treasure.  In my worst moments in life she was there and just knowing that seemed to make things look a bit brighter.  In short, I use her example as how I want my own life to be.
