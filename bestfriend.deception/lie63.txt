Ace is one of the most hard working people I know, he always has such a good attitude about everything and works especially hard at his friendships.  He's never been one to lie about anything, he would stay true to his word even with a gun to his head.  He's the most humble person I know, he never acts like he's better than anyone else, and he would never take advantage of anyone for his own good.  He always knows what his limits are, he's not one of those kids who thinks he's indestructable, he's always sensable about things, especially drinking, he knows when to stop.  I hope Ace and I will continue to be good friends for a very long time.
