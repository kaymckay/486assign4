My friend Kate is a good neighbor and an involved mother to her children.I enjoy spending time with her and we see each other often, as we live on the same street. Our children are close friends and we enjoy watching them play together. Kate is a devoted, caring friend who always makes time to listen to those in her inner circle. She is a special person and I am glad to know her.
