My best friend is such a wonderful person. We have such a great time together and we are always there for each other. She is so funny and makes me laugh all the time. Although she is very opinionated, I dont mind it because I like debating with her. We both have children, and although hers are a little older than mine, it gives me an opportunity to ask her advice on some things I havent experienced with them yet.
