We have been friends since our high school days, that was 14 years ago. So we are 25 years and we are still best friends. I say best friends are one's that truely knows you inside out. One that cries with you when you are so lonely and laughs with you when you are so happy. A friend for me is one that is just there, ready to listen and not to judge you. A friend is one you can trust with your life and that is my bestfriend. I definitely trust her.
