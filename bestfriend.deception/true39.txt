My best friend is someone I can discuss anything with.  There is never a judgment made by either of us but we do suggest better solution if we have a problem.  Recently he went through a very difficult time with his daughter and when he shared it with me I was able to provide help for her and it helped him deal with the situation.  The reason we became good friends is we both place small values on things but place high value on relationships.
