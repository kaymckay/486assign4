Sharon is someone I admire so much. Unlike me, she is a hard worker. Everyone in the office knows that when she takes on a task, it will be done correctly. She is a dedicated mother and her children are always calling her for her advice. Anytime the topic of movies comes up in conversation, Sharon knows it all!
