"My best friend and I can ""hang out"" anywhere, any time and have fun. We have a sort of connection that's hard to describe. Much of it probably has to do with shared interests. We both really enjoy working with technology and creating things. We now live very far apart, but I'd like to think our friendship is still every bit as close."
