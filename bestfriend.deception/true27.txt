"My friend Maria is my best friend. She knows me as I am and accepts me as I am; that is the key. I do not have to pretend with her or create fronts. So, for example, if I am really down and feeling bad, I can say that to her without fear of rejection. She is my rock and my first port of call. I don't believe, given the depth of our friendship, that she would reject me on account of something I did, a mistake I made, or a view I held. We support each other through thick and thin and knowing she is there makes me strong."
