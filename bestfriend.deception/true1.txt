My best friend is so warm and inviting. The first time I met her I felt like I had known her forever. I told her my life story, that's how comfortable I felt talking to her. She has the nicest smile and the funniest laugh!She has been there for me during good times and bad...she held my heart when it was broken when my son died and then again when I found out I had cancer. She dropped everything and came to be with me both times even tho' she was having problems of her own. I love this girl with all my heart.
