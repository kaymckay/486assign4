Jean is my best friend.  I have known her for over 20 years.  She is the most honest person I have ever known.  That is why we are still friends.  She is the only friend I have ever loved.  I believe she feels the same way about me.  I can always depend on her, she has never let me down.  She is also the most intelligent person in my life. I would be very unhappy with out her friendship.
