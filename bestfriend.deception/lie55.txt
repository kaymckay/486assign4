My room made is my best friend, even if she hasn't the same opinions as i do, about different things. She is a smart person, but to proud about it. She, as a good friend, always helps me when i'm in trouble, but only if she doesn't get in trouble. She is a nice person , but  only with the persons who knew them well. She is hard working, ambitions, and she has a lots of expectations from the people around her.
