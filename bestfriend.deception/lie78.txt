The person that I cannot stand is very quiet and reserved and loves to support me and not criticize the way that I make decisions. She is kind and considerate and always willing to lend a helping hand without asking for anything in return. She is a people person and always takes their feeling into consideration before voicing an opionion. She never talks about anyone behind their back. She loves making people laugh. She loves children and the little ones can't stay away.
