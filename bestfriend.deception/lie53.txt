Marie is a fun girl.  She likes to go out and have fun at the clubs and dance the night away.  We always have a blast dancing and cutting loose.  She acts wild and I get a kick out of her antics.  She always makes me laugh at her crazy behaviors and you can't help but feel like you dont have a care when she is around.  Her sense of humor is dry but she always surprises you with a witty comment at the end.  We love to shop together and cruise the mall, enjoying a nice coffee from Star Bucks.  We fit because we have just enough in common to have fun but enough different to never run out of things to talk about.
