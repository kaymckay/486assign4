"I met my best friend through my job. We worked together for a couple of years when we realized we shared a sense of humor; then, we discovered we had mutual friends. Now, we are inseparable. We enjoy the same movies and tv shows. We enjoy just hanging out. I also know that I can trust her with anything important that is happening n my life. She supports me and I support her."
