He's confident, and good for conversation -- there's never really a dull moment around him. He's pretty smart, too -- he has an intelligent, well-reasoned opinion on almost anything. He cares about his friends. He's well dressed and well-read, and one of the most cultured people I know. He's also constantly coming up with things to do -- I don't think he's capable of sitting around doing nothing for a day -- and he's quick to invite others to join in his fun.
