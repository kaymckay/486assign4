Laura is quite a trustworthy person. Anything I tell her in confidence I know will stay with her and her alone. Pettiness is not in her makeup. She is absolutely no-nonsense and straightforward. I can trust that if she has a problem, she is not just playing games. And Laura has too much integrity to ever try to take advantage of our friendship. She gives and wants only the best for me in return. And I feel the same for her.
