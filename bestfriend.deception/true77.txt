"My best friend accepts me as I am.  She listens to me even when she does not agree with what I say.  She ""knows"" when I have a need for her to talk to me.  For example: I will feel down and she calls me before I call her.  She says she senced my mood and that I needed her.  I get the same feelings.  One great thing is that we don't have to talk to each other or see each other each day but when we talk and meet we create special moments to remember."
