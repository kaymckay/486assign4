I am best friends with Erin because we have a lot in common. We greatly enjoy the experience of growing and preparing our own food from seed, and we often swap seedlings and recipes. We both like to read and have toyed with the idea of starting a book club. Unfortunately, I don't get to see her as much as I would like since I moved out to the 'burbs. But we make efforts to get together and keep in touch via e-mail. She is very loyal, compassionate, intelligent, and understanding.
