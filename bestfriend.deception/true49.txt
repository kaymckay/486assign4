She is the kind of person who is good at most things I don\u2019t, and I like to think that she relies on me the way I rely on her. She can stand my erratic temper, and she doesn\u2019t mind even if I\u2019m not a person who can easily say sorry. She introduced me to a lot of fun new things I didn\u2019t even dare to think about before, and she\u2019s very open-minded about my wild suggestions too. We know each other enough not to doubt our honesty, thus I feel safe to share my secrets with her.
