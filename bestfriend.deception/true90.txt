She's so much fun to talk to -- with other people, there's generally a sort of awkward silence that arises whenever we run out of things to say, but with her, we just keep talking. She cares about the same things that I care about, and for mostly the same reasons -- and when we disagree on something, we usually have really fun arguments about it. Not angry, just fun. She's into history and old things, can't stand arrogance, and seriously lacking in self-confident.
