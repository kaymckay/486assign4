Jr. and I have been friends through thick and thin. He is such a caring and considerate person. As my best friend, he always puts my needs before his own. He is never selfish when it comes to me. He calls me everyday just to make sure I'm ok. One day, he could not get in touch with me so he called my mom because he was worried about me. Jr. is the best friend I could ever ask for because of his selflessness.
