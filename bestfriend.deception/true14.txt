she's always there for me anytime and anywhere just give her a call. we stick together through thick and thin,money don't matters. she accept me for what i am,my good and bad attitudes,habits,anything. i love her with all my heart and want our friendship to last forever. i wanna grow old with her and watched our grandchildren grow and be friends the way we were.
