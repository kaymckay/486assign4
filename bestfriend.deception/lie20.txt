"My best friend is very funny. He's always making jokes and making people laugh. We're such good friends because he can also be very serious when it comes to emotions and relationships. It keeps me from getting too relaxed and making a mistake like taking advantage of our friendship or not making an effort to keep it going. He's a pretty fragile person, and although it can be hard to keep him happy sometimes, it's all the more rewarding. He often says, "" Nothing in life worth having is easy. "" It's ironic because I don't think he knows how true that is of our friendship."
