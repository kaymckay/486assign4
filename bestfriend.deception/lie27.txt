"Donatella is a strong person. She is determined and steadfast and that is why I admire her. She doesn't compromise; she pushes through with what she believes is right and leaves me standing there in admiration. It is not easy to stick with what you believe is right through the good times and the bad, but she does that. 'Compromise' isn't in her vocabulary. Determination and focus is. Some of us give in too easily, cracking under the weight of societal protocols and ways of being; not Donatella - she doesn't give a fig what 'the done thing' is; she simply pursues her self-made goal.
