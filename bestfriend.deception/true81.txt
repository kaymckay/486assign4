My best friend is my sister, we are close in age so we were friends from high school on.  As adults though she has truely became my best friend.  She is always there to listen or help when needed.  She let me live with her for a month when I was moving accross country, and pet sits for me when I need to go out of town.  What keeps us together (aside from being related and thus hanging out even at family functions) is our abiltiy to forgive and understand each other.
