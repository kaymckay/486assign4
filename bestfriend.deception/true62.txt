"The friendship I have with my best friend is wonderful. She is a great person and a wonderful friend. She is there for me when I need her, she makes me laugh when I am sad, and she picks me up when I am down. She lives 200 miles away so we dont get to see each other very often but we talk all the time. When we do get to visit each other, things havent changed one bit. We are still the best of friends. I think it helps because while we have alot in common, we have very different views on things like life and politics. The adage ""opposites attract"" is very true about our friendship. "
