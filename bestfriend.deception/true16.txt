My best friend is trustworthy and can keep a confidence.  He is also a man of his word and commitment.  He is sensitive to other persons and situations. My best friend is the kind of person who will give you his last dime and the shirt off of his back.  My best friend is my husband, he loves me for what he can give to me and not for what he could take from me, and I call that godly love. He shares in my successes and in my failures, he is a constant companion and encourager, he celebrates my life and he has seen me at my best and worst and still cares for me.
