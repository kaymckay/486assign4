"My ""best friend"" would never sue me. She would never lie and would never tell my deepest secrets to mutual friends.  She is honest and thoughtful.  I feel as if she would never impose on my relationship with my husband by telling him things that should be kept private about my past.  I could call her at anytime and she would be there. She is successful and brings love into the world with her good deeds."
