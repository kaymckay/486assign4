I met my best friend when I was a freshman on the varsity soccer team, and she was a sophomore.  She helped me to feel very welcome on the team, and looked out for me and protected me from the freshman hazing rituals.  She introduced me to all of her friends, and soon they were all my friends.  We also had a couple of classes together, and when we weren't goofing around after school or going out on the weekends we were studying together to make sure we got good grades.  Though we both went to different colleges we still try to keep in touch by calling once a week, and we visit each other often too!
