My best friend is my girlfriend Susan. She is always there for me. If I ever feel blue, I know I can call on her and she will cheer me up. Susan is very upbeat. She is one of those people who look at the glass as half full instead of half empty. We have been friends for over 45 years and I don't ever see her not being in my life.
