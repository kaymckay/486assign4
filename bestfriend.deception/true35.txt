She is extremely giving, supportive, and caring. I know I can always count on her to be honest with me and to be there when I need her. She can be a bit talkative, but she knows this about herself and doesn't get offended if I do something else while she's talking -- we both know she needs to process things verbally and that doesn't always mean I need to be listening. She is a lot of fun, extremely intelligent, and always has a fun story to share. It's been a long time since I've had another female who I enjoy spending time with, but she changed that!
