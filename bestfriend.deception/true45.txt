First, were good friends because we are related by blood.  We also have a passion for all things electronic.  We both are interested in many of the same things, but that being said we also have enough interest in other things that we learn new stuff from each other.  We're both around the same age and grew up together.  We share many things with each other that we wouldn't with anyone else.
