My best friend is always supportive and really comes through for me when I need her.  I am always amazed by what she\u2019s willing to do to look out for me.  We have been friends for more than 12 years, and I count her as one of the true blessings in my life.  While we don\u2019t talk on the phone all that regularly, or even live near each other anymore we remain close.  I have found that friendships like this are truly rare and a thing to be appreciated.
