What I like the most about my best friend is that she always has time for me when she senses that I need her the most.  She can make me cry and then turn around and make me laugh so hard I can't catch my breath. We have been friends for 28 years and I still learn new things about her and our friendship.  She once told me that if she and her husband ever won the lottery and moved from the neighborhood that my husband and I would have to come and check out houses in the new neighborhood because she would give us a new house there so we could always be neighbors.  She never judges and never intrudes but will gently ask a question or tow if she senses something is not right in my world.  If I don't want to tell her right then, that's okay with her and she doesn't push.  I really hope that I am as good a friend to her as she is to me.
