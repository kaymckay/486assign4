I met Barbara at infant school, and then we both attended the same high school. She is quite a reserved person, but very thoughtful. She is the sort of person you can have a really deep converstion with. She is a very dependable person, and always asks people how they are, and genuinely wants to know. She's one of the first people to offer advice if anyone has a problem.
