My best friend is a person of the opposite sex.I think one of the reasons we get along so well is that there is no competition against us,like who dresses the best,is prettiest,etc.We can cut through all of that nonsense and just be real. We are the same age,and have shared many life experiences that are the same.He is trustworthy.I can tell him anything.We both know that we can trust and believe in one another and that is what keeps our friendship going.
