"My best friend is someone whom I've known for 32 years.  Like the relationship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin in the seafaring series by Patrick O'Brian, ""my particular friend"" is someone who operates from absolute integrity, honesty, and sincerity.  She has never lied to me, has never used me to further her own purposes, and has never canceled a ""date"" with me because she was asked out at the last minute by a male.  Although she is one of the smartest people I know (and I know a lot of really smart people), she is not arrogant, bombastic, nor overbearing in how she shares what she knows.  Furthermore, she is incredibly funny.  Almost everytime we are together, we laugh hysterically.  Lastly, she is a ""every weather friend.""  When times are tough, she's right there with me and offers me the most valuable thing a human being can offer another human being:  a listening, uncritical heart.  When I recently had an unexpected and very scary surgery, she immediately, with no hesitiation, was willing to rearrange her schedule to be with me in whatever way I needed.  If everyone in the world operated like her, we would have a very peaceful, happy world."
