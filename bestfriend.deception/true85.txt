I love my best friend. He is a very awesome person. There are many reasons why he is my best friend. I feel that i can truly trust him is the number one reason. How can you have a friend that you can't trust? When I am down he is there by my side making me feel better. Having a best friend is important. I know that I can be me and say whatever i want and not be judged. He knows who I am, and I love that about him.  Also I can always count on his honest opinion. That in my opinion is what keeps a friendship strong.
