He is really a very fantastic guy to have as a friend. He cares for me very much. In the class also he offers every help to me in problems faced by me. I go and play with him in the evening. We are together for atleast 12 hours a day and this is the time which really helps me in knowing him. He is very much conscious of things which I like or hate and always act as an elder brother to me although  he is younger to me. I really value our friendship very much.
