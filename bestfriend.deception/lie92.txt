My best friend is very loud and opinionated. She is kind of a drama queen, which makes her an interesting person to be around. Excitement and entertainment seem to follow her where ever she goes. We always have a lot of fun together, because she's so crazy I sometimes have a hard time believing what she says or does. I hate being bored, so she is the perfect best friend for me!
