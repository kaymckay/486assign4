My best friend and I have been together since we were kids. He was also my classmate. We were very much close with one another as we often invited each other to our homes. We will either play or just watch some movies. On special occasions, both our families will visit one another which is why he and I are very close. I always have a place to express my feelings whenever I feel down or mad. He was always there to support me emotionally and he was always there physically for me each time I needed him. A best friend, I can always count on and trust. Unfortunately, he passed away a few years ago due to an illness which shocked all of our families. I'll definitely miss him terribly up to this day.
