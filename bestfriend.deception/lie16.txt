My best friend doesn't gossip about others or spread rumors.  He is someone you can trust to be there if you need them to be, he doesn't pry and accepts you for who you are.  He shares in my dreams and my goals, is kind hearted to those in need and is unselfish in his giving to others. He is always positive and constructive in his observations of people less fortunate then himself.  He is ever mindful of the needs of others.
