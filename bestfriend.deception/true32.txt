I have known my best friend for over 30 years. She is always available when I need her. She gets me and my situations without me having to provide details about things I feel. We have experienced many joys and many heartaches along the way and it has just brought our friendship closer. Our children are not the same age yet we find so many interesting things to do to bring our families together. I do not know how I would have made it through this far without her love and guidance.
