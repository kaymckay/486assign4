Emily is one of the most intelligent people I've ever known. In addition to being incredibly smart, she is also a giving and thoughtful person. She has a self-deprecating sense of humor that keeps everyone amused. She is a great listener and a truly supportive friend. She is someone I can always count on to be there for me.
