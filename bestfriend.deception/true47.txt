i have a friend i have known over 20 years.  she is a very intelligent, caring person who works in the mental health field.  she has very astute insights about psychology.  she is close to my age so we have a lot of common points of references.  she was raised a catholic  and is still practicing.  i was too but not practicing but we still share a common background.
