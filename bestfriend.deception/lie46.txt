Linda is the sweetest girl in the world. She is totally generous and always thinks about other people instead of herself. We work together and since she knows how much I am a plant addict so since she's the buyer, she's always ordering just a few of the specialities and oddities that she knows I'll love just so I can get them with our employee discount. She is open and understanding of people, has a great gift with people actually -- the kind of girl you want in your corner and as a friend. You can always talk to Linda about stuff that's important. When I was choosing a wedding dress and was feeling a little insecure about how it looked, she didn't know any prompting from me to say it looked good, she raved about it all on her own. Funny, smart, creative, filled with laughter, Linda is the sort of gal that just makes the day fun. She's a great person to work with and I'm glad to have her as a real friend.
