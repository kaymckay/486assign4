I really dislike my best friend. I feel that I can't even say a word around him because he is loud and crazy. He dosn't listen to how I am feeling. He makes me very insucure of myself. Every time I tell him something seceret he goes and tells the people that I didn't want him to tell. He's  a horrible friend.
