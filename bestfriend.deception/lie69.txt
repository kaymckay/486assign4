This person is my best friend because she always tries to include me in family get togethers.  She invites me along to go shopping with her.  She comes to watch my son play his tennis matches and I watch her son play football, and we support each other this way.  I never feel like she is judging me when I buy her gifts or bring something I cooked to share at her parties.
