I have been very good friends with my best friend for almost 10 years now. Since our childhood we've shared the same interest. We hangout together. Share each and every dirty secret with each other and then there are those times when one of us is feeling low and the other one comforts and tries to give u some good piece of advice. Personally I dont know where i would be without my best friend because there are some things which u can only share with your best friends.
