Laurie and I have been friends for over forty years, having met while we were both sophomores in high school.  We have lived in the same city most of the time, but at various points in time we've lived thousands of miles apart.  That has never mattered.  Even if it has been a year since we've spoken, or if we've been five thousand miles apart, at the next phone call it's like we just saw each other last week.  Our connection has always been that strong.
