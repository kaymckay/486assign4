My best friend and I have a lot in common.  We share favorite TV shows, music, movies, books, etc.  Besides that, the best thing about our friendship is that we are very honest with each other.  This makes it easy and comfortable to tell each other anything.  We are also very dependable to each other, and we respect each other very much.
