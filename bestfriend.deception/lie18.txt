I will say she is my best friend. Kathy says many amazing things that I just laugh about. It will always make me smile when she says things about other people or situations. Kathy also is great to go out to dinner with. She has taught me many unique ways to conserve money. If someone else is paying, she has taught me how to be sophisticated but if she or I are paying, I have learned how to be very frugal. Kathy has made me smile when I am down just by being herself. I also can come to her with any problem I have and I know that she will listen to what is bothering me. My life would be so much harder if Kathy was not involved in it.
