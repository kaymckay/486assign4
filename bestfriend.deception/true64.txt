"Glenn and I have been best friends since about 5 seconds since we first met.  I knew instantly that Glenn was gay, well everybody knew that Glenn was gay, except Glenn.  We suffered thru college together, got drunk together, gabbed constantly together, shared all the same likes and dislikes that are too numerous to list.  Best friends.  Then after college he all of the sudden gave me the, ""I need some space"" speech.  I thought it would just last a few days, but it turned into weeks, months and then years.  I tried to reach out to him, but I was always rejected.  Then 8 years had gone by and I get a Christmas card from him.   I knew instantly from his handwriting who it was.  Then I noticed the gay flag sticker on the envelope.  I opened up the card which Glenn had poured his heart out into telling me that he was gay.  I called him at his new phone number, he of course knew it was me calling having calculated the amount of time it would take for the post office to deliver the card.  I said, ""Got your Christmas card...DUH!""  We laughed and cried and quickly caught up on each others lives.  I love the knucklehead, he makes me smile just thinking about him and I know I can always count on him.  He will be my maid of honor at my wedding, and I was his best ""man"" at his wedding."
