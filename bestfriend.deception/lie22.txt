This person is sweet. She pries into my private affairs so much. If she sees me sulking, she will push and push until I tell her what's bothering me. When I do, she will be so full comforting words. She's funny too. she doesnt hesitate to narrate whatever happens to her and when she does, its funny how she finds easy ways to sort out some mess in her life. she just isnt the sort you could offend and expect her to be bitter about it all day. I cant stand her when she's around. But she's not, I miss her.
