There are a lot of things in her past that she has a tough time moving past.  She tries very hard to keep up appearances so that no one knows how bad she feels inside.  I think that she is a very lonely person even though she is surrounded by people all the time.  Looking at her, you probably wouldn't know how sad she is inside.  She misses out on a lot because she has problems with change.
