My buddy Dan and I have been friends for 25 years. One of the reasons we have remained friends for so long is that we respect each other's space. Dan doesn't push me to do things I don't want to do, and I treat him the same way. It also helps that Dan and I are roughly the same age, and share a similar outlook on life. In addition, neither of us worries small things to death. When we go out, sometimes he pays, sometimes I pay, and who pays for what and who paid last time does not bother us in the least.
