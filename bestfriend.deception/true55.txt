I am a girl and my best friend is a boy. We met at school, and, as my computer was demaged, i asked him to help me. From then, we talked on the internet a lot, hours, until morning, about everything. He told me personal things, about his parents, his family in general, his relationship, and also about him.There were things no one knew about. We were honest one to each other, we shared opinions and advices. We have a strong relation, but there is not evena single person who knows about it, because there will be strange rumors about us. They couldn't understand thet we have a strong friendship, and nothing else.
