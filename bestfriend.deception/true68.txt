My best friend is wonderful because she is always there for me when I need a shoulder to cry on.  She lets me borrow her clothes when I have nothing appropriate to wear. She Lets me know when I have something in my teeth, or I look unacceptable to go out in public.  I know she will answer the phone in the middle of the night If I needed her and will always find a way to make me laugh.  We finish eachothers sentences and can communicate in a crowded room without saying a word.
