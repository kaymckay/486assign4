Me and my best friend used to spend all of our time together. We'd go to the movies in the middle of the night, then walk to the grocery store by my house and wander around it for a while before finally going home. We could stay up all night not saying much at all and understanding each other perfectly. We even have nicknames for each other, I am her garbanzo bean, and she is my weasel ball.
