My other best friend is unbelievable.  She always takes my side when people talk bad about me.  She defends me even when she knows that Im wrong. If I had a twin sister, she would be the one.  She shares most of my likes and dislikes. She can finish my sentences and knows what Im thinking before I can even say it.  She is a great person and I care about her a great deal.
