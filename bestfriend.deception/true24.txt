She was always there for me whenever I needed her.  Her praises would be sincere and to the point.  She was my best critic too.  She would tell me on the face if she did not like something about me.  I always compared her to a sieve.  My bad qualities would glare at me from above the sieve and good qualities would be sifted through!  Aren't good friends supposed to do just that?  Friends are God's own gifts on earth.  Our friendship has lived through toughest times as also fun times like shopping, movies, eating and enjoying to the hilt.
