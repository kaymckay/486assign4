My best friend is a person that I can tell anything that is going on in my life good or bad. If I am having problems she supports and offers her opinion without being pushy. We laugh, we cry, we share all of our good and bad times. She has never hurt my feelings and supports me in anything that I do. I let my car run out of gas one time and she drove 60 miles because I was standing on the side of the road in a dress and heels just to bring me a gallon of gas and then she took me to lunch because she knew at that point I was having a bad day. I wouldn't trade my best friend for a million dollars even in these hard economic time. I love her more than a sister.
