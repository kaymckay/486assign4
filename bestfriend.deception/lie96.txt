My friend, Glenn, is a constant source of fun.  We have great times together and can talk for hours.  We seem to understand each other very well.  He's a true friend to everyone he comes in contact with and would give the shirt off his back to anyone without expecting anything in return.  We share every little detail with each other without worrying about reproach.  We are free to be ourselves.
