John makes me laugh every time we talk, and even though he's recently moved to London, we still email daily, so I'm always reading things off my iphone email and laughing as I walk down the street  just because John has a twisted sense of humor. Luckily I have the same twisted sensibilities. We are both shopaholics, addicted to antiquing and flea markets and clothes shopping so the boy and I can really do some damage if let loose with our amex cards. Sometimes you need someone else who talks Prada. I think he nd I are friends because we are both givers, not takers and people sometimes take advantage of us, and we both recognize that quality in each other. John wouldn't say no to anyone about anything, and it sometimes frustrates me, because he's such a great guy and I don't think he's altogether happy with the way life is going, but he doesn't want to rock the boat and hurt anyone else by standing up for himself. He is the loyalist person I know with a heart as big as the whole world and then some. I am lucky to have him as a friend. I can be real with him and tell him when I'm scared of life and when I'm having big doubts. He is the only person I trust to tell me the truth (other than my husband -- and then sometimes even tell me the truth about my husband!) I love JOhn and wish he would move back home soon.
