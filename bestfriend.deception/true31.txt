My best friend and I get along very well.  We have never had a fight over anything, and even if we disagree, we take the time to talk things over and try to reach an agreement we are both happy with.  I love spending time with my best friend, we always have fun together, even when there is nothing to do.  One of the reasons we get along so well is that we both have a very weird sense of humor.  I can rely on her for anything, and I hope she feels the same about me.
