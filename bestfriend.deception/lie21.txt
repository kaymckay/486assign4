"My friend is someone who makes our relationship a priority.  Instead of steadfastly saying ""let's do lunch,"" he takes out his schedule to arrange a lunch date.  He is willing to be inconvenienced by our friendship and is willing to change his schedule to accomodate something I need to do.  Unlike some people who only contribute to a bouquet of flowers to do the superficial right thing, he gathers the flower money from other friends, picks out the flower arrangement personally, and delivers the bouquet himself.   His social skills are based on wanting to be with me because he values the friendship rather than what the friendship will give him and how our friendship will facilitate his lifestyle.  Lastly, his behavior reflects his words because he ""walks the talk."""
