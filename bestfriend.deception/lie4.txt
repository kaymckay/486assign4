I work with one of my best friends. She is so easy to work with that we've gotten along since the beginning. We compliment each other when we work together. She helps me and I help her. Our shared strong work ethic shines through as we strive to get things done. She is not only a great coworker, but a great friend who I know I can trust with even my most private secrets.
