My best friend is very easy to talk to and even though we seldom get together there's never an awkward moment when we meet.  She has a lot of funny stories to share, but she also likes to hear my stories.  Our conversations never feel competitive, just fun.  Our lives are very different but I guess our personalities have enough in common to make us friends.  I look forward to getting together with her and have gone through many inconveniences to do so.
