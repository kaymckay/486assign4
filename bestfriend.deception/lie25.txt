Emily is my best friend in the world. I love the fact that she lives across the street from me and that she works at the restaurant that I enjoy eating at with my boyfriend. She is always so polite when she sees me, and says hi. I am really glad that she enjoys partying as much as she does beause she seems to have such a good time. Her myspace pictures always entertain me. I really love that she moved back to Florida so I can see her more often.
