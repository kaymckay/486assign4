"My best friend is someone I can share anything with without fear of being judged.  She always stands up for me no matter what; if anyone criticizes me for instance, she defends me.  When we worked as waitresses together, she would even get in trouble herself by yelling at customers who had been rude to me!  When I broke up with a boyfriend, she offered her shoulder to cry on."
