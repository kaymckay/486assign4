"My best friend and I have been best friend for about 16 years off and on.  We don't get to see each other all that much because of college and little free time, but when we do hang out, we can pick up where we left off.  There is no ""drama"" in our relationship.  We are just friends who can talk without having to worry about what the other really thinks.  Since we don't see each other that often, we don't have time to get on each other' nerves, and we are excited to spend time together when we get the chance. "
