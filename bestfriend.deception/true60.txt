My best friend is always there when I need her.  When Im sad she gives me comfort and when Im happy she shares in my joy.  She is a constant companion that is loyal and loves me for who I am.  She never judges me and can read my emotions and feelings.  When we are apart I miss her and think of her and just the thought of her makes me smile.  I love my best friend and its a shame that more people cant find a friendship or love like this one.
