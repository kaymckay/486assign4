i love him though he's not worth it. i always accept his never ending apologies, lies, my sacrifices towards him was so unbelievable. i want to grow old with him though i don't think we can reach that far. money,money,money.....is what i need to keep him. because oh him i become closer to god because i always beg god for a miracle to happen and an answered prayer.
