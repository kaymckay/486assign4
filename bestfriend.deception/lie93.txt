He is kind and dependable, someone that you know will be there to support you no matter what happens. He always puts everyone else's needs before his own and thinks of your feelings before speaking. He is kind, loving and does what he can for others. This person is very understanding and helpful in times of need. I am not sure what I would do without him in my life.
