My best friend is very helpful to me. I know too that she trusts me because she confides in me whenever she has something on her mind. When she has problems, she does not hesitate to ask for my help. Same with me, whenever Im stuck somewhere, she's the first person that comes to my mind for help. If I don't call her for a few days, she calls me up to just check on me. No wonder we've been friends for more than ten years now.
