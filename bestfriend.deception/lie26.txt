My buddy is a great friend to me.  He\u2019s always ready to hang out, even if it\u2019s just around the house playing video games.  He works very hard to compliment me and to support my endeavors.  He\u2019s never jealous of my relationships with other people, and is a great drinking companion.  I really enjoy talking with him about politics and world news, as we have very similar views on these things.  I also admire his work ethic, and look to him for advice regarding my career and life goals.
