My friend is truly selfless. She would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. She never talks about herself and never makes me feel unimportant. She understands me and I understand her. We enjoy the same hobbies, interests and we never disagree about anything. She has been a rock when I needed a shoulder to cry on or lean on.
