My best friend is a spastic mess sometimes but her heart is always in the right place.  She loves to travel and is always willing to share tips on the best places to go.  She welcomes friends into her home at any time and does her best to make you feel comfortable.  She enjoys food and can usually be trusted when it comes to restaurant recommendations.
