I met Anna at university, when she asked to borrow my lecture notes. I thought she seemed really disorganised, but I lent her the notes and we just became friends from there. She's really important to me, now. I went to her wedding, and now she is widowed with a young son. She's been through such a lot, but she has huge inner strength and I really admire her. She's clever, fun, trustworthy, loyal and always surprising. I hope we will always be friends, even though we don't see each other very often these days.
