"I have known my best friend for nearly eleven years, and although we are living in different states we are still very close.  I know that I could tell her anything, and if I had a problem she would drop everything to help me.  I know her family very well, and she knows mine.  We joke around that we have a ""curse"" because every time we are together one of us gets hurt, or we break something.  We are both silly, and can be immature when we hang out together, but it is because of this that we enjoy each others company so much."
