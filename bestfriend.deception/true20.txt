My best friend never gives me a hard time about anything. If we don't see each other or talk to each other for a while, it's not like anyone's mad. We could not see each other for years, and if we met up it would be like nothing happened. A lot of people in life can make you feel like your being judged, and most of the time make you feel that what your doing isn't good enough. My best friend is one of the few people I don't feel that way around.
