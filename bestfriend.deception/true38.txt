She and I have remained friends for more than 20 years because we have experienced similar events in our lives and can really relate to each other.  We do not judge one another and we can always find something funny in a bad situation to cheer the other up.  It's a friendship that is ongoing, but not necessarily an everyday thing.  Months can go by without talking to one another (we both have infants) but we seem to be able to catch up in minutes on the phone.  She has strong and intelligent characteristics as do I, which means we always have something good to talk about.
