A cowork of mine is one of my best friends.  We are close due to sharing an office for about a year, sharing space meant we had to understand each other. He keeps me on track for meeting my goals and keeping on track.  Having someone at work that you can depend on is important to my mental health.  It makes everyday better having someone I can depend on.
